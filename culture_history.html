    	<h2 class="text-center bg-primary">History of Bangladesh </h2>
        <p class="text-warning">Mahasthangarh (Karatoa River) is the oldest archeological site in all of Bangladesh, and is said to have been inhabited since the 3rd century BC. It is home to a wide range of ruins, including the famous Govinda Bhita Temple, Parasuramer Bedi and Mankalir Kunda, all of which showcase the country’s Hindu roots. Excavations in the Mainamati-Lalmai range revealed various Buddhist remains dating back to the 8th through the 12th centuries. The Mainamati Ruins (Comilla District) stretch 11 miles in the hilly region and consist of more than 50 ancient Buddhist sites and monasteries with priceless stone and bronze sculptures depicting gods and goddesses.</p>

<p class="text-warning">Bangladesh’s early history can be characterized by conflicts, power struggles, shifts in authority, and bloody disasters. Political instability plagued the territory from the early days of Alexander the Great, which continued through the Muslim rule in the 13th century and to the arrival of European traders and settlers during the 15th century. Britain triumphed in gaining economic influence and political rule (by the mid 1700’s), reigning over West Bengal for almost 200 years.</p>

<p class="text-warning">After WWII, Britain was forced to downsize its empire, leaving the future of the Bangladesh territory in the hands of Viceroy Lord Mountbatten, working with Mahatma Gandhi to unite the two major religious factions in the area — the Hindus and the Muslims. Fearful of being a minority in a Hindu-dominated India, the Muslims made it impossible to bond the groups, which led to a partitioning of the subcontinent into Punjab (the Muslim state) and Bengal (the Hindu state). Dominion status was granted to two successors, Pakistan and India. After a bloody exchange following the separation, the Hindus deserted both wings of Pakistan and moved into India, while the Muslims took over what was then known as West and East Pakistan.</p>

<p class="text-warning">Soon after, the two areas discovered they had nothing in common (besides their Muslim faith). Not only was the territory separated by some 994 miles of Indian land – they also had very different cultural backgrounds and spoke very different languages. Western dwellers knew Urdu, while eastern residents spoke Bangla. Economic disparities, unfair administration, and the declaration of Urdu as the national language in all of Pakistan led the Bengal-speaking east Pakistanis to assert themselves and demand self-government.</p>

<p class="text-warning">Succeeding events like the president’s refusal to open the National Assembly and the formation of the independent state of Bangladesh (literally Bangla-land/country) led to one of the century’s shortest and bloodiest wars. Indian forces supported the freedom movement, leading to an all out war between Pakistan and India. After nine months and more than three million casualties, Bangladesh was declared the 139th country in the world.</p>

<p class="text-warning">Historic events leading up to the liberation of Bangladesh are remembered through monuments at the National Martyrs’ Memorial in Sava and the Shaheed Minar (Dhaka Medical College). The Liberation War Museum (5 Segun Bagicha, Dhaka) contains some of the rarest archival photographs of the period along with items used by the martyr freedom fighters.</p>

Curzon Hall, named after Lord Curzon (Viceroy and Governor-General of India, 1899 – 1905) who laid the foundation stone in 1904, was originally intended to be a town hall. Now, as part of the school of science of the University of Dhaka, it has become an emblem of educational tradition of Bangladesh due to its significance in education during the post-independence era of the country as well as afterwards.</p>

                    <p>Bangladeshis eat Bhat (boiled rice) as their staple food and major intake; about 70 percent of what they eat is based on rice, which is their main source of carbohydrate, though health conscious people take rooti or chapati (wheat-based carbohydrate). Unlike other foods, bhat is eaten after mixing it with curry. Generally there is Bhaji (fry) and Bharta (mash), basically made of countless varieties of vegetables and fishes. Then they take a Jhol of different vegetables, cooked separately or mixed or added with fish. They also take dal (soup made of pulses) and have different kinds of ghonto and shukto or Chutni (pickles) to enhance taste.</p>

                    <p>Tradition of a few Thousand Years. This is another noteworthy part of Bangladeshi culture. Nakshi Kantha (embroidered quilt), said to be indigenous to Bangladesh, is made from old cotton clothes, predominantly discarded sari, dhoti and lungi.Kanthas range from utilitarian quilts to exquisitely embroidered heirlooms. Depending on the thickness required, three to seven saris are layered and quilted with the simple running stitch, which typically produces a rippled effect. Thread drawn from coloured sari borders would be used to embroider motifs or border patterns imitative of sari borders.</p>
